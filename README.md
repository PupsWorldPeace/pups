## How to Use

### Adding Your Content

Content for the galleries (images and videos) is managed through the `media-manifest.json` file located in the root directory.

1.  **Place Files**: Add your image files (e.g., `.webp`, `.jpg`, `.png`) to the `assets/images/` folder and video files (e.g., `.mp4`) to the `assets/videos/` folder.
2.  **Update Manifest**: Edit `media-manifest.json` to include entries for your new files. Each entry should be an object with the following properties:
    *   `type`: `"image"` or `"video"`
    *   `src`: The full path to the file (e.g., `"assets/images/your-image.webp"`).
    *   `title`: A display title for the item (e.g., `"My Awesome Photo"`).
    *   `category`: A category name (e.g., `"nature"`, `"abstract"`, `"projects"`, `"meme"`).
    *   `thumbnail` (for videos only): **Note:** While this property exists in the manifest, the video gallery now uses the first frame of the video (`src`) for the thumbnail display, not this image path.
    *   `description` (optional): A short description for the item, displayed in the modal view.
3.  **Memes**: Place meme image files (jpg, png, webp, gif) in the `assets/memes/` folder. The manifest generator will automatically assign them the category `"meme"`.
4.  **(IMPORTANT)** After adding/removing files in `assets/images`, `assets/videos`, or `assets/memes`, run the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    python generate-manifest.py
    ```
    This will update the `media-manifest.json` file so the website reflects your changes.

Example entry in `media-manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "src": "assets/images/by_charlie69746042_post_0d55ff7d_03ca_4d55_8466_b4977b5ce8c1.webp",
  "title": "By Charlie - Post 0d55ff7d",
  "category": "abstract",
  "description": "An abstract piece by Charlie."
}
```

### Running the Site

You can run this site locally using any simple web server. Here's how to start one with Python:

```
# If you have Python 3 installed:
python -m http.server

# Or with Python 2:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Or simply open the index.html file in your browser.

## Customization

- Edit `css/styles.css` to change colors, fonts, and styles
- Modify the HTML files to adjust layout and content structure
- Update JavaScript files to change behavior and animations
